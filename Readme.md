This project is a fully automated **stateful multi‑agent CRM platform** built using **LangGraph, LangChain, FastAPI, SMTP/IMAP, and Google Calendar API**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

TechNova is a fictional AI‑driven consulting company that helps B2B clients modernize operations using AI, cloud, and MLOps.  
This CRM system automates the **entire customer acquisition pipeline**:

1. **Lead Discovery (Recruitment Agent)**  
   - Analyses synthetic dataset of potential customers.  
   - Assigns intent scores and shortlists top clients.

2. **Email Outreach (Interaction Agent)**  
   - Generates personalized email drafts using LLMs.  
   - Allows user to edit & approve emails in UI.  
   - Sends emails via Gmail SMTP.  
   - Continuously polls inbox via IMAP for replies.

3. **Scheduling (Scheduler Agent)**  
   - Extracts meeting availability from customer reply.  
   - Auto‑schedules meetings in Google Calendar.  
   - Sends real calendar invites.

4. **Call Analytics (Analytics Agent)**  
   - Ingests call transcript (demo uses synthetic one).  
   - Produces summary, key themes, pain points, next best action.  
   - Stores results in summary file.

5. **Supervisor Agent**  
   - Orchestrates full stateful workflow end‑to‑end.

6. **Streamlit UI**  
   - Shows each agent step clearly.  
   - Users manually approve key actions (email sending, scheduling).  
   - Real‑time inbox monitoring + activity logs.
